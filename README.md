## Introduction  
An emergency information distribution service built to help keep students safe in the event of school shootings. This was the first architectural iteration, with a frontend built in Vanilla Javascript. Built using Node.JS, Express, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. Red Alert allows schools to quickly respond to emergencies by combining real-time communication, precise student geolocation, and role-specific features for students, guardians, and administrators. The app empowers schools to take control during critical incidents with speed and clarity. Implements unique backend security, utilizing school-based RLS in database, coupled with JWT tokens, and then user-based security in backend.
